		<h1>Assignment 2.2 â€“ Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
		<!-- Header Tag of H2 for the Chapter Title -->
		<h2>Get to know Justin Morrow</h2>
		<!-- Write four (4) paragraphs, each with at least three sentences, that provide an introduction to you.
		You might describe your hometown, childhood, hobbies, family, etc.  -->
		<!-- First Paragraph -->
		<p class="intro">I was born in West Jordan, Utah but my mother moved us to Albuquerque, NM where I've lived my entire
		life excluding 1.5 years in Seattle, WA when I was 21 due to a job promotion. I did live in a smaller suburb outside of
		Albuquerque for my 8th grade through 12th grade years but consider Albuquerque my hometown. Our city hosts the International 
		Balloon Fiesta every year. <span class="sentence">Our question asked is "Red, Green or Christmas?" Which references what type of chili you want on your food.</span>
		I prefer Green, my wife prefers Red and my son prefers Christmas which is both Red and Green. Other things known in our state is
		the graveyard of Billy the Kid, the UFO incident in Roswell, Carlsbad Caverns, the longest Aerial Tram, Espanola the Low-Rider capital
		of the world and the show Breaking Bad.</p>
		<!-- Second Paragraph -->
		<p>I was raised as an only child by my mother and step father which I consider my Dad. I have two half sisters I've met once.
		<span class="sentence">My parents both passed away while I was in my twenties and the good Lord blessed me with amazing in-laws that treat my like their son.</span>
		My amazing wife and I have been together for 24 years and both our kids are recent graduates. My life is spent mostly at work,
		but my job schedule allows for me to be home each night and for all important events.</p>
		<!-- Third Paragraph -->
		<p>I love technology and understanding how things work. As a kid I used to take apart toys to create new ones. After high school I went
		to ITT Tech to get my Associates degree in Electronics and because of that degree and my working in tech support at a call center it landed
		me into my career as a Telecommunications Engineer since the year 2000. I enjoy learning how to code because I like visually seeing something
		I built, since I'm not skilled in areas like wood working or construction. I enjoy video editing, playing games Xbox with my son, watching movies
		with the family or relaxing in the backyard. <span class="sentence">I start and end my day reading the Bible and giving thanks for my life.</span></p>
		<!-- Fourth Paragraph -->
		<p>My hopes from this course and ultimately my Bachelors degree is to <span class="sentence">ensure I continue to be relevent in my area of work</span> since I still have almost 20 years
		to work before I can retire. I enjoy the class assignments where we get to see each others posts and examples to get different perspectives on coding
		since there are so many ways to do things and such great resources out there you don't always find just google searching stuff. The other thing I'm enjoying
		is that we get time to learn front and backend programming rather than a quick video on youtube or couple week class that promises to learn all you need to 
		know in a few weeks.</p>
